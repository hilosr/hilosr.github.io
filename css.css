"Once upon a time there was a teacup named teacup, a teacup that was so beautiful as a pearl, but a horrible teacup on the inside.
Teacup would always act prettily infront of those drinking from her, but on the inside she would think of horrible ways to poison
them. Ever since she was created by an English woman very many years ago, Teacup was always horrible. The English woman....i forgot
about the English woman, but she did did die by the tea's saucer."
